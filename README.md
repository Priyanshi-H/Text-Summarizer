This project demonstrates the use of advanced techniques for text summarization using an extractive summarization method called the BM25 algorithm. At first, we loaded the necessary libraries and related functions in python, and then code was implemented to summarize the text. Afterward, a model is proposed with slight expansions to improve by showing the outline text. The techniques that are presented in this project to get better results in text summarization with Rouge Score library in NLP. With this, the overall meaning of the document can be understood easily. The main.py contain executable code, Text_summerizer contains code for summary of text , and gui_test contains python code using tkinter as library for gui platform.
